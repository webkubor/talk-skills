Writing docs, filing tickets, posting updates, customer service — **when the content is right but nobody reads it, or it smells like generic robotic AI generation**, it's usually not the content's fault. It's these four steps done out of order, plus a lack of atomic granularity for audience minds:

```
① Skeleton   conclusion-first · SCQA · MECE (no overlap, no gaps)
② Audience   for human vs agent; up vs across; platform audience psychology
③ Tone       situational attribution · self-disclosure · anti-AI · no fake platitudes
④ Read-aloud read as a first-time reader, check against a list
```

The cost of skipping ④, measured: a 9,918-word technical report, after a read-aloud pass, surfaced 20 problems — **19 only found by reading**. Content drift into adjacent sections, references to deleted chapters, the same document contradicting itself in two places. Linters only catch leftover wording.

## Six skills and atomic matrix

| Skill / Matrix | Covers | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **how-to-write** | The full method — the four steps above | Before writing anything meant to be read by someone else |
| **atomic-matrix** | **5D Atomic Expression Matrix**: [View CheatSheet](skills/atomic-matrix.md) | Composing custom [Who]×[Where]×[Scenario]×[Tone] blocks |
| **platform-voices** | Platform mindsets: NetEase/Xiaohongshu/X/GitHub/WeChat | Publishing on specific media with platform-native voices |
| **scenario-openers** | Scenario openers & Anti-AI authenticity guide | Customer inquiries, issue handling, hook phrases, killing AI taste |
| **peer-facing-writing** | Written peer communication: ticket skeleton, per-sentence substitution table | Issues, review comments, cross-team reports |
| **talk-text-review** | Talk posture: is this an "I'll teach you" or a "let's talk" piece | Before sharing with peers or seniors |
| **talk-visual-review** | Visual acceptance for the deck | Before producing the final visual |


## One-line Multi-Agent & Local GUI Integration
 
Automatically link to **~/.agents/skills** global standard center, **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **DSH**, and **Local GUIs (Antigravity IDE)** via smart symlinks:
 
```bash
# Option A: In the local repository directory
./install.sh
 
# Option B: One-line remote installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webkubor/talk-skills/main/install.sh | bash
```
 
> **Note**: Uses symlinks. Any future modifications to the local source code take effect immediately across all agents without reinstallation. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for more agent configurations.


## What it doesn't cover

Expression splits into four layers. This repo owns only the first; the rest live elsewhere with no overlap:

| What to say | What it looks like | How it's spoken | Where you write |
|---|---|---|---|
| **talk-skills** | [facet](https://github.com/webkubor/facet) | [voxflow](https://github.com/webkubor/voxflow) | [typora-Bloom-theme](https://github.com/webkubor/typora-Bloom-theme) |
| structure · tone · attribution | type scale · whitespace · pagination · rendering | voice design · stage presence · pacing | editor environment |

Quick ownership test: "what should I say, in what order, will this offend?" → this repo. "How big a font, how much whitespace?" → facet. "How do I deliver this line?" → voxflow. Full breakdown in [BOUNDARY.md](BOUNDARY.md).

## Why the rules look like this

Every tone rule is anchored to a psychological mechanism, not "be nicer":

- **Fundamental attribution error** → don't write "your test method is wrong"; write "this trap isn't visible from the UI" (attribute to the situation, not the person)
- **Face threat** → imperative tone triggers defensiveness; people protect ego before processing information
- **Backfire effect** → "you're wrong" makes people dig in harder, especially in tickets with third-party observers
- **Self-disclosure lowers defense** → if you've stepped in the same hole, say so first

Structure follows the Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto): conclusion first, top-down, grouped (MECE), logical progression.
